# Census_Project

The overall aim of this project is to analyse a modestly sized town’s 1881 census to make justified recommendations about what should be constructed on an unoccupied plot of land that the local government wishes to develop and what sector should the government invest in.

To offer recommendations that are credible and reasonable, an efficient approach was introduced and used to ensure effective data cleaning, seamless data visualization & analysis and to inform a conclusion towards achieving the aim of this project.

The first task was to clean the dataset. As it was rapidly discover, there are missing entries, and, candidly, some responses from the population are outright lies.

The town from the census is a modestly sized one sandwiched between two much larger cities that it is connected to by motorways. The town does not have a university, but students do live in the town and commute to the nearby cities. The project task is to decide the following:
(a) What should be built on an unoccupied plot of land that the local government wishes to develop? The choices are:
  (i) High-density housing. This should be built if the population is significantly expanding.
  (ii) Low-density housing. This should be built if the population is “affluent” and there is demand for large family housing.
  (iii) Train station. There are potentially a lot of commuters in the town and building a train station could take pressure off the roads. But how will you   identify commuters?
  (iv) Religious building. There is already one place of worship for Catholics in the town. Is there demand for a second Church (if so, which                  denomination?), or for a different religious building?
  (v) Emergency medical building. Not a full hospital, but a minor injuries centre. This should be built if there are many injuries or future pregnancies      likely in the population.
  (vi) Something else? 
Note: The chosen answer was justified from the data provided and argued as a priority against other choices.
(b) Which one of the following options should be invested in?
  (i) Employment and training. If there is evidence for a lot of unemployment, we should retrain people for new skills.
  (ii) Old age care. If there is evidence for increasing numbers of retired people in future years, the town will need to allocate more funding for end of     life care.
  (iii) Increase spending for schooling. If there is evidence of a growing population of schoolaged children (new births, or families moving in to the 
  town), then schooling spend should increase.
 (iv) General infrastructure. If the town is expanding, then services (waste collection; road maintenance, etc.) will require more investment.
 In order to address these two questions, The following analysis were undertaking:
  • Examined the age distribution (age pyramid) of the population. if it growing or shrinking? Will there be more retired aged people in the future, more        school-aged children, more young people, etc.
  • Examined unemployment trends. Are there certain ages more likely to be unemployed than others.
  • Examined religious affiliations. Are there any religions growing, or shrinking? Are there any newer religions that are increasing in numbers?
  • Examined the divorce and marriage rate. This might impact housing situation.
  • Examined the occupancy level (how many people per house) and determined if existing housing is being under or over-used.
  • Examined the number of university students. All of these are commuters since there are no universities in the town. Are there any other professions that     are likely to be commuters?
  • What is the birth rate and death rate for the town?

Result
It was concluded that the town’s population is aging. The community currently has a low birth rate. Future increases in the birth rate are likely due to the town's high marriage rate compared to its low divorce rate, as well as the number of unmarried people and minors living there. There is no need to construct a new house of worship because the community is not religious. More than 50% of the populace uses the highways to get to one of the two considerably larger cities. Considering the age trend, the jobless rate is modest. Due to the fact that students and lodgers make up the majority of residents, the number of high-densely occupied flats is quite low.

Recommendations
Since most of the population commutes, it is suggested that a train station be built on the vacant parcel of land based on the evidence and facts from the census data. In the future, in addition to the increasing immigration, there would be more graduates who would enroll in universities, subsequently adding pressure to the roads. Second, the government is urged to fund eldercare due to the town's aging population. Since it is obvious that the number of retirees will rise in the coming years. As a result, the community will require additional financing for end-of-life care.
